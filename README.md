## Work performed by each group member

### Loki - Database Design and Development:

Loki worked on the design of the database and its creation on the back end. His work can be seen in the Database design document.

### Daniel Hibbin - Game Design and Development:

Daniel Hibbin worked on the game design and development for the PenguinRunner game. His work was performed in the Godot Game Engine and his work can be seen in the `PeguinRunnerGodotProject` directory. This game engine supports HTML5 exports and the initial export can be seen in the `PenguinGameExport` directory. All of the files in this directory are the results of compilation and are not commented as a result. These compiled files are also placed in `The-Kingfish\mysite\static\game`.

This game engine uses GDscript as a language, which lacks any strongly enforced standards or guides. Daniel has tried his best to format and comment this code to be as readable and professional as possible. 

### Daniel Banks - Front End Design and Development:

Daniel Banks worked on the front end of the website. This included the creation of the static `.html` files and `.css` files and ensuring their compatability with the back end.
