        <h2>About</h2>

        <div class="para">In the UK there are 30,000,000 tonnes of litter collected annually, and there's plenty that
            goes uncollected in nature. The litter lasts - It takes 10-20 years for a littered plastic bag to
            degrade,80-100 years for an aluminium can, while plastic and glass bottles may never degrade.</div>

        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <div class="para">We are a dedicated team of individuals driven by our passion to devise an enjoyable solution
            that encourages
            and
            enhances recycling efforts.</div>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>

        <div class="para">Our mission is to develop an engaging game aimed at raising awareness of littering among
            students on campus.
            We
            aspire to address the issue of littering in a manner that is both enjoyable and environmentally sustainable.
            To
            realise this vision, our game incorporates an innovative approach â€“ users can scan QR codes located on bins,
            to
            give themselves coins they can play with. Additionally, they can answer a quiz on sustainability for extra
            coins
            if they answer correctly. To further promote sustainability, players can compete for the best high score,
            encouraging them to think more about sustainable waste disposal.</div>

        <h2 id="getcoins">FAQ</h2>

        <h5>How do I earn coins?</h5>

        <div class="para">You can earn coins by scanning QR codes on bins around campus. You get a base amount from
            that, and you also
            have the option to take a sustainability quiz to earn additional coins. You can also buy different
            backgrounds and titles in the shop.</div>

        <h5>What can I spend my coins on?</h5>

        <div class="para">You can spend your coins on the Sustainability Slide game, try and get a new highscore to
            compare with
            friends.</div>

        <h5>Is there a limit on scanning QR codes?</h5>

        <div class="para">You can only scan the same QR code once a day. However, there are multiple QR codes around
            campus, so there
            is
            no limit on how many different QR codes you scan a day!</div>

        <h5>How does this help the environment?</h5>

        <div class="para">Our aim with this game is to make people more aware of locations of bins around campus. By
            enhancing this
            awareness, we aim to reduce instances of littering and promote a cleaner, more environmentally conscious
            campus
            community. Incorporating a quiz component into the game serves as a clever mechanism to encourage ongoing
            engagement with sustainable practices beyond just waste disposal.</div>

        <h2>Charities</h2>

        <div class="para">Here are some useful links that you could look at. These charities help remove litter from
            streets, and help
            look after injured animals affected by litter.
