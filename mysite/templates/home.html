        <div class="para">More than 2 million pieces of litter are dropped in the UK every day. That’s around 30 million
            tonnes a
            year. The amount of litter dropped has increased by 500% since the 1960s. A lot of this litter ends up
            in
            the sea, affecting sea life more than we know.</div>

        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <div class="para">We are a dedicated team of individuals driven by our passion to devise an enjoyable solution
            that encourages
            and
            enhances recycling efforts.</div>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>

        <div class="para">Our mission is to develop an engaging game aimed at raising awareness of littering among
            students on campus.
            We
            aspire to address the issue of littering in a manner that is both enjoyable and environmentally sustainable.
            To
            realise this vision, our game incorporates an innovative approach – users can scan QR codes located on bins,
            to
            give themselves coins they can play with. Additionally, they can answer a quiz on sustainability for extra
            coins
            if they answer correctly. To further promote sustainability, players can compete for the best high score,
            encouraging them to think more about sustainable waste disposal.</div>

        <h2 id="getcoins">FAQ</h2>

        <h4>How do I earn coins?</h4>

        <div class="para">You can earn coins by scanning QR codes on bins around campus. You get a base amount from
            that, and you also
            have the option to take a sustainability quiz to earn additional coins.</div>

        <h4>What can I spend my coins on?</h4>

        <div class="para">You can spend your coins on the Sustainability Slide game, try and get a new highscore to
            compare with
            friends.</div>

        <h4>Is there a limit on scanning QR codes?</h4>

        <div class="para">You can only scan the same QR code once a day. However, there are multiple QR codes around
            campus, so there
            is
            no limit on how many different QR codes you scan a day!</div>

        <h4>How does this help the environment?</h4>

        <div class="para">Our aim with this game is to make people more aware of locations of bins around campus. By
            enhancing this
            awareness, we aim to reduce instances of littering and promote a cleaner, more environmentally conscious
            campus
            community. Incorporating a quiz component into the game serves as a clever mechanism to encourage ongoing
            engagement with sustainable practices beyond just waste disposal.</div>
